3. Install required Python libraries:
```

## Usage & CLI Menu

Once running, you'll see a menu with these options:

1. **Add Transaction** 
   Enter date, category, type (Income/Expense), amount and description.

2. **View All Transactions**  
   See a detailed list of all transactions with index numbers.

3. **View Summary**  
   Shows total income, expenses, and net savings.

4. **View Expense Breakdown by Category**  
   Shows how much you spent in each expense category.

5. **Filter Transactions (Date/Category)**  
   Search transactions by a date range or specific category.

6. **Delete a Transaction**  
   Remove a transaction by its index.

7. **Plot Expense Pie Chart**  
   Displays a pie chart of your expenses broken down by category.

8. **Plot Monthly Income/Expense Trends**  
   Shows a line chart of income and expenses over months.

9. **Plot Expense by Category Bar Chart**  
   Shows a bar chart visualizing total expenses per category.

10. **Save & Exit**  
   Saves all transactions into `data/transactions.csv` and quits.

## Data Persistence

- Your transactions are saved in `data/transactions.csv`.
- On startup, the app loads this CSV; if it's missing or empty, the app loads 100 sample transactions from `src/sample_data.py`.
- Be sure to save before exiting to persist any new or modified data.

## Who Is This For?

- Beginner to intermediate Python users who want a real-world project to learn from.
- Individuals wanting a lightweight tool to track personal finances via CLI.
- Developers looking to build on the project by adding GUI, reports, authentication, or more.

---

## How It Works: Overview of Code Components

- **`src/models.py`**: Defines `Transaction` and `TransactionManager` classes for managing transaction data.
- **`src/sample_data.py`**: Contains 100 predefined sample transactions for testing/demo.
- **`src/tracker.py`**: Functions for user interaction like adding, deleting, filtering, and printing transactions.
- **`src/visualizer.py`**: Functions using matplotlib for generating charts to visualize financial data.
- **`main.py`**: Ties everything together with a menu-driven CLI loop.

---

## Future Enhancements

- GUI using Tkinter, PyQt, or another framework.
- User authentication & multi-user support.
- Budget limits, alerts, and notifications.
- Monthly or yearly financial reports generation (PDF or CSV).
- Integration with bank APIs for automatic transaction imports.
